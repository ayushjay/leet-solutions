"""
In Python, when you write:


listNode1.next = listNode2
Here's what's happening:
listNode1 is assumed to be an instance of a class like ListNode, which has a .next attribute (typical in a linked list).

listNode2 is another node (also a ListNode).

What does this line do?
You're not copying listNode2 into listNode1.next.
Instead, you're saying:

"The next pointer of listNode1 now references the same object that listNode2 references."

So listNode1.next is now pointing to the same memory location/object as listNode2.

What does “reference” mean in Python?
In Python, variables don’t hold objects directly—they hold references (pointers) to objects.

So, when you do:


a = SomeObject()
b = a
Both a and b point to the same object. If you modify b, a reflects the change, because they refer to the same object in memory.

Applying this to your case:

listNode1.next = listNode2
You're setting listNode1.next to reference (point to) the same node as listNode2.

Visually:


listNode1 --> listNode2 --> ...
If later you do:


listNode2.val = 10
print(listNode1.next.val)  # This will print 10
Because listNode1.next is not a copy of listNode2, it's the exact same node.
